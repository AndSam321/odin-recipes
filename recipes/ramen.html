    <p>Authentic Japanese-style Ramen in your home!
        Best ramen recipe in the world!</p>
</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Sesame Oil:</strong> Used for cooking the vegetables in. 
        I love using sesame oil to cook with 
        because it adds the best nutty flavor.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Minced Garlic:</strong> 
        Makes the broth nice and savory!
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Sliced Mushrooms:</strong> Regular brown mushrooms 
        work great here! 
        You can also use shiitake mushrooms.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Chicken Stock:</strong> Chicken broth is typically what 
        I have on hand and great for a savory soup base. 
        If you want your ramen to have more of the classic Tonkotsu flavor, 
        use pork broth instead. You can also use vegetable broth as a 
        vegetarian/vegan alternative. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Water: </strong>
        Adjusts the consistency of the ramen soup.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Soy Sauce:</strong> Add a splash for savory flavor!
    </li>
    <li>
        <Sstrong>Baby Bokchoy:</Sstrong> 
        I love adding greens to ramen. 
        These can be chopped or left whole. 
        You can also use spinach!
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Instant Ramen Noodles:</strong> You only want the uncooked noodles. 
        Throw out those seasoning packets! 
        You can also use fresh ramen noodles if you can find them.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Salt and Pepper:</strong> Add to taste.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
        <strong>Sauté Vegetables:</strong> Add the sesame oil into a large pot and heat over medium heat. 
        Add in the garlic and ginger and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant. 
        Add in the sliced mushrooms and cook for 3-5 minutes or until softened.
        </li>
        <li>
        <strong>Add Liquids:</strong> Pour in the chicken stock, water, and soy sauce.
        </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Simmer:</strong> Then bring to a boil and simmer for about 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cook Bokchoy:</strong>  Add the bokchoy and then simmer for an additional 2 minutes to soften the leaves.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Add Noodles:</strong> Remove the pot from the heat. 
        Then place the ramen noodles in the hot pot of broth. 
        Allow the noodles to sit for ONLY a couple of minutes until they loosen and soften up. 
        The noodles will soften quickly, so this should be done right before serving. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Transfer to Serving Bowls:</strong> Divide the ramen, veggies, and broth evenly into bowls.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Add Toppings:</strong> Top the ramen with sliced grilled chicken and soft boiled eggs. 
        Then garnish with toppings of choice and enjoy!
    </li>
    </ol>
